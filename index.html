<h2>Abby Burris</h2>
<h3>Description of data</h3>
<p>The data describes the population of people in North Carolina by county aged 18 to 24 that have a highschool education or equivalent. The data is from the 2020 census.</p>
<h3>Ratio chosen</h3>
<p>The ratio I chose was to divide the study population (18 to 24 year olds with a highschool degree or equivalent) in a county by the total population of 18 to 24 year olds in that county. This ratio is done for each of the counties in North Carolina. The ratio is then multiplied by 100 to get a whole number value. This means that the intervals are the number per 100 people</p>
