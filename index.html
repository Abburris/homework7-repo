<h2>Abby Burris</h2>
<h3>Description of data</h3>
<p>The data describes the population of people in North Carolina by county aged 18 to 24 that have a highschool education or equivalent. The data is from the 2020 census.</p>
<h3>Ratio chosen</h3>
<p>The ratio I chose was to divide the study population (18 to 24 year olds with a highschool degree or equivalent) in a county by the total population of 18 to 24 year olds in that county. This ratio is done for each of the counties in North Carolina. The ratio is then multiplied by 100 to get a whole number value. This means that the intervals are the number per 100 people</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(48, 40, 118);">Natural breaks</h2>
<p>This classification finds the inherent boundaries where there are large differences between two values to determine each interval. A benefit of this classification is that you can use if for classifying data that is not evenly distributed. It finds the largest difference between two classes and the smallest difference within each class. One con of using this classification is that the classes can be heavily influenced by outlier values. Its also not very good at illustrating uniformly distributed data.</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(48, 40, 118);">Equal Count</h2>
<p>This classification places an equal number of data points in each interval. One benefit of this classification is that it is easier to find the median in the data becasue there is the same amount of data points above it as below it. It also minimizes the class variability. One negative thing about this classification is that the scale within intervals can be very large because the same number of data points is being put in each interval. This can lead to bad representation of data if there are outliers. </p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(48, 40, 118);">Equal Interval</h2>
<p>This type of classification makes each interval have the same width. This means that each interval increases by the same numerical increment. One good thing about this classification is that the equal width intervals make it easy to interpret and compare to other maps with the same classification. One negative attribute of this classification is that it doesn't always illustrate distribution very well. For example, it might create an interval that doesn't have any data points to represent it.</p>
